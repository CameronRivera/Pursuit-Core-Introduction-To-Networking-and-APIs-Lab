# Part Two

Status Code Scavenger Hunt!

Use Postman to find each of the following HTTP codes:


1. 200

Request Succeeded.

Nothing needs to be done.

1. 301

Moved Permanently. 

Nothing needs to be done assuming there is an automatic redirect. 

1. 400

Bad request.

Find the source of the problem and fix it. Whether that is incorrect spelling, or something else. 

1. 401

Unauthorized.

I would obtain authorization if possible. 

1. 403

Forbidden.

I would obtain authorization if possible.

1. 404

Not Found

I would use a different site as a source. 

1. 418

I'm a teapot.

It is a joke. No action required. 

1. 500

Internal Server Error.

No action required. 

For each of the questions below, write:

1. The website which generated the HTTP status code
2. A description of what the status code means
3. If an app you were writing encountered this status code, what would you do (if anything) to resolve any issues?
